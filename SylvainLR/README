This code can be used to find a path between a starting point and a destination.

To build it, you just have to use "$ make" in a command line.
Then, to run it, use "$ ./src/main"

It works by virtualy drawing a line between starting point and destination and then deform it to follow the obstacles frontiers and spare it.
Their is no guarantee for the path to be the shortest but, in many common cases, I think it's pretty good and efficient.
